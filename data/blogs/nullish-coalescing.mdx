## What is Nullish Coalescing?

The Nullish Coalescing Operator (`??`) returns the right-hand value when the left-hand value is `null` or `undefined`,
and returns the left-hand value otherwise.

Since this operator allows us to detect and bypass `null` and `undefined`, it is typically used to
provide default values.

In the example below, each log statement logs "Default". The first is because `leftHand` is `undefined`, and the
second is because `leftHand` is `null`.

```javascript
let leftHand; // undefined
const rightHand = 'Default';

console.log(leftHand ?? rightHand); // 'Default'

leftHand = null;

console.log(leftHand ?? rightHand); // 'Default'
```

This might look weird, and maybe it seems magical.

In reality, we can actually achieve the same logic using
operators/expressions we're already familiar with. By explicitly checking for `null` and `undefined`,
we can determine whether `leftHand` or `rightHand` should be returned:
```javascript
let leftHand;
const rightHand = 'Default';

console.log(
    leftHand !== null && leftHand !== undefined
        ? leftHand
        : rightHand
);
```

So really, it's just syntax sugar... But it's pretty _sweet_ sugar, right??

## Nullish Coalescing with Optional Chaining

Nullish coalescing works great for getting default values, but it works even better with optional chaining (`?.`)! If
you're not familiar with optional chaining yet, check out the <Link href="/blog/optional-chaining">blog post</Link> or
corresponding <Link href="https://youtu.be/Xd_uK4rAL3E">YouTube video</Link>.

The code below produces a runtime error when we try to reference and invoke `getFullYear` because we're not passing
a _defined_ date argument into the function:

```javascript
function logYear(date) {
    const now = new Date();
    // Error if `date` is not defined!
    const year = date.getFullYear()
        ?? now.getFullYear();

    console.log('The year is:', year);
}

// Error
logYear();
// Error
logYear(null);
```

Using optional chaining, we can gracefully handle both the `undefined` and `null` cases, and fall back to
`now.getFullYear()` with nullish coalescing:

```javascript
function logYear(date) {
    const now = new Date();
    // No Error :)
    // `date?.` handles `null` and `undefined`
    const year = date?.getFullYear()
        ?? now.getFullYear();

    console.log('The year is:', year);
}

// No Error :)
logYear();
// No Error :)
logYear(null);
```

## Caveats

While the nullish coalescing operator is quite helpful, there are a couple caveats.

#### Requires Parentheses when Combined with Other Logical Operators

Nullish coalescing can't be combined with logical `||` or `&&` operators - you'll get a SyntaxError without using parentheses
to tell the code which parts of the expression take precedence.

```javascript
let age = 30;
let leftHand;
const rightHand = 'Default';

// SyntaxError
console.log(age && leftHand ?? rightHand);

// Fixed!
console.log(age && (leftHand ?? rightHand));
```

It's likely rare you'd run into a case that requires `||` or `&&` _and_ nullish coalescing, but it's important to
keep in mind nonetheless.

That said, you can have multiple nullish coalescing operators without parentheses:

```javascript
let age = 30;
let leftHand;
const rightHand = 'Default';

// No SyntaxError
console.log(age ?? leftHand ?? rightHand);
```

#### May Require a Polyfill

According to <Link href="https://caniuse.com/?search=%3F%3F">Can I Use</Link>,
Chrome added support for `??` around August 24, 2020, so it's relatively new. Additionally, IE doesn't support
it at all (big surprise ðŸ™„). Thus, you may need to polyfill the nullish coalescing operator if you're targeting IE
or browsers before August 2020.

As for NodeJS users, it's <Link href="https://node.green/#ES2021-features-Logical-Assignment-----basic-support">supported
back to version 15</Link>.
