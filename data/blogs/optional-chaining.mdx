## What is Optional Chaining?

The optional chaining operator (`?.`) allows you to safely retrieve a value, or even call a function, from a nested
object when any of the references along the way may be `undefined` or `null`.

If an object or function preceding the `?.` operator is `undefined` or `null`, JavaScript will short-circuit the
evaluation (bail out early) and return `undefined`.

## How is it Used?

Let's see an example where optional chaining could help. In the example below, we have a dog and a puppy. The dog's
(Dug's) owner is Carl, but the puppy (Luna) doesn't have an owner yet because she's a newborn. If we naively assume
every dog has an owner and try to log out the name, we'll get an error when we get to Luna because the `owner` and
`name` properties don't exist:

```javascript
const dog = {
    name: 'Dug',
    owner: {
        name: {
            first: 'Carl',
            last: 'Fredricksen'
        }
    }
};

const puppy = {
    name: 'Luna'
};

const dogs = [
    dog,
    puppy
];

dogs.forEach((dog) => {
    // Error when we get to Luna!
    const owner = dog.owner.name.first;

    console.log(`${dog.name} is owned by ${owner}`);
});
```

Without optional chaining, we might fix the loop like this:
```javascript
dogs.forEach((dog) => {
    // `if` statement protects against
    // `null` and `undefined`
    if (dog.owner && dog.owner.name) {
        // No error now
        const owner = dog.owner.name.first;

        console.log(`${dog.name} is owned by ${owner}`);
    }
});
```

That's fine, and there's nothing wrong with that approach, but optional chaining makes this easier and cleaner - especially
when the object is more deeply nested.

For this example, we can use optional chaining like so:

```javascript
dogs.forEach((dog) => {
    // `owner` doesn't exist on Luna,
    // so `?.` returns `undefined`
    // which is evaluated to `false`, which
    // doesn't pass the `if` condition.
    if (dog.owner?.name) {
        const owner = dog.owner.name.first;

        console.log(`${dog.name} is owned by ${owner}`);
    }
});

// Or, perhaps another way:
dogs.forEach((dog) => {
    // If both `owner` and `name` are defined,
    // `first` will be returned. Otherwise,
    // `undefined` will be returned.
    const owner = dog.owner?.name?.first;

    if (owner) {
        console.log(`${dog.name} is owned by ${owner}`);
    }
});
```

### Using Optional Chaining with Functions

Using `?.` with property access is really helpful, but using it with functions can be useful as well.

Let's modify our code to:
1. Add a `bark` function to Dug (Luna won't get one yet since she's still too young)
2. Call the `bark` function after logging out each dog's owner

Here's the code updated with `bark`, but we still get an error:

```javascript
const dog = {
    name: 'Dug',
    owner: {
        name: {
            first: 'Carl',
            last: 'Fredricksen'
        }
    },
    bark: () => {
        console.log('I can bark!');
    }
};

const puppy = {
    name: 'Luna'
};

const dogs = [
    dog,
    puppy
];

dogs.forEach((dog) => {
    if (dog.owner?.name) {
        const owner = dog.owner.name.first;

        console.log(`${dog.name} is owned by ${owner}`);
    }

    // Error on Luna, she doesn't have a `bark` function!
    dog.bark();
});
```

To fix the error, use `?.` again:
```javascript
dogs.forEach((dog) => {
    if (dog.owner?.name) {
        const owner = dog.owner.name.first;

        console.log(`${dog.name} is owned by ${owner}`);
    }

    // No error now :)
    dog.bark?.();
});
```

Woah, that syntax looks wonky - `?.` _before_ the parentheses `dog.bark?.()`?

Yep! The syntax may be unfamiliar, but remember it's the _function_ we're trying to protect. In this case, if `dog.bark`
is `null` or `undefined`, JavaScript will bail out and return `undefined`, without trying to invoke the nonexistent
function.

### Optional Chaining with Arrays

Let's add a `toys` array to Dug for his favorite toys. As you guessed, Luna won't get any yet since she's so young.

```javascript
const dog = {
    name: 'Dug',
    owner: {
        name: {
            first: 'Carl',
            last: 'Fredricksen'
        }
    },
    bark: () => {
        console.log('I can bark!');
    },
    toys: ['Squirrel']
};
```

Now we'll add a log statement to log out each dog's favorite toy, but we'll do it without optional chaining first.
As with the other examples, we'll get an error when trying to access `toys[0]` on Luna because the `toys` array
doesn't exist:

```javascript
dogs.forEach((dog) => {
    if (dog.owner?.name) {
        const owner = dog.owner.name.first;

        console.log(`${dog.name} is owned by ${owner}`);
    }

    dog.bark?.();

    // Error!
    console.log(`${dog.name}'s favorite toy is: ${dog.toys[0]}`)
});
```

Using a similar syntax to the function example, adding the optional chaining operator fixes the problem:

```javascript
dogs.forEach((dog) => {
    if (dog.owner?.name) {
        const owner = dog.owner.name.first;

        console.log(`${dog.name} is owned by ${owner}`);
    }

    dog.bark?.();

    // No error now :)
    console.log(`${dog.name}'s favorite toy is: ${dog.toys?.[0]}`)
});
```
