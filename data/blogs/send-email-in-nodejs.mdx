## What is SendGrid?

_This post is **not** sponsored by SendGrid._

[SendGrid](sendgrid.com) is a platform that provides tools and APIs to
send automated, customizable, and scheduled emails.

They offer a generous free tier, allowing up to 100 free emails per day forever (at the time this post was
written, at least). Definitely more than enough to play with for a personal project or small business. If you need more
than 100 emails per day, the lowest-tier paid plan offers about 50k emails per month for $15. Super reasonable!

## Create SendGrid and Gmail Accounts

1. Create a SendGrid account (it's free to sign up, and no credit card required).
2. Create a Gmail account (or use one you already have). No special settings required.

## Authenticate a Sender

SendGrid has what's called a _Sender Identity_ - this is what your user will see as the "from" field when they receive
an email from your app.

On the SendGrid dashboard you'll find two options: creating a single sender and authenticating a domain.

For production-level applications, and as recommended by SendGrid, you'd want to authenticate a domain - but for this
tutorial we'll use a sender identity (Gmail address). The code we'll use to send the email is no different in
either case.

From the dashboard, select **Create a Single Sender**, pictured below.

/>

1. From the dashboard, select **Create a Single Sender** (pictured above).
2. Fill out the form that pops out. **From Email Address** should be the Gmail address you want to appear as
the sender. For the other fields, use real or fake data based on your use case.
3. Once you've filled out the form, select **Create**.

## Creating a Project and Installing Dependencies

First, create a project folder:
```bash
mkdir send-email-in-nodejs; cd send-email-in-nodejs
```

Then, initialize an npm project:
```bash
npm init -y
```

Create the two files we'll use:
```bash
touch index.js .env
```

And finally, install the SendGrid and dotenv packages:
```bash
npm i --save @sendgrid/mail dotenv
```

## Create a SendGrid API Key

Back in SendGrid, select **Settings** > **API Keys** from the sidebar.

    width={1280}
    height={720}
    alt="API Keys CTA"
/>

For permissions, select **Restricted Access**, and give it the "Mail Send" permission (pictured below). You can give
the API key additional permissions based on your use case, but it only needs to send email for this tutorial.

    height={720}
    alt="API Key Permissions"
/>

Select **Create & View**, then copy the API key to the clipboard. Add the API key to your `.env` file.

```env
// .env file
SENDGRID_API_KEY=<your API key here>
```

## Sending an Email

All the code we'll need to send the email is in the below 26 lines!

1. `dotenv` pulls in our environment variables for use
2. We set the API key from our `.env` file
3. Invoke the `sendMail` helper function

```javascript
// index.js file
require("dotenv").config();

const sgMail = require("@sendgrid/mail");

sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

const sendMail = async (msg) => {
    try {
        await sgMail.send(msg);
        console.log('Message sent successfully!');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);

        if (error.response) {
            console.error(error.response.body);
        }
    }
};

sendMail({
    to: "any.email@example.com",
    from: "your.sender.email@gmail.com",
    subject: "NodeJS Says Hello!",
    text: "It's really this easy!",
});
```

In your terminal, from your project's directory, run the `index.js` file:

```bash
node index.js
```

Go check the email account in the `to` field, and you should see the email come in!
