## What is SendGrid?

If you're not familiar with it yet, [SendGrid](sendgrid.com) is a platform that provides some robust tools and APIs to
send automated, customizable, and scheduled emails.

They offer a pretty generous free tier, allowing up to 100 free emails per day forever (at the time this post was
written, at least). That's more than enough to mess around with and even integrate into a small business or project.
Even the paid plans allow something like 50k emails for $15/month. Super reasonable! (This post is not sponsored by
SendGrid)

## Create SendGrid and Gmail Accounts

If you don't already have a SendGrid account, go ahead and sign up. As mentioned, it's free to sign up, and there's no
credit card required.

Most people already have a Gmail account, but if you don't (or you want to use a different one for this tutorial) then
create one of those too.

## Authenticate a Sender

SendGrid has what's called a _Sender Identity_ - this is what your user will see as the "from" field when they receive
an email from your app.
